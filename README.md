# PyScreenSaver
By Urban Versis 32

## Basic info
A simple screensaver program for Python built using Tkinter and Turtle. I found this project that I made a while ago and I decided to continue it.

##Versions
* v0.1.0-beta - The original project

##Python Modules Used
* turtle
* tkinter
* tkinter.ttk
* random
* time
* sys

## Developer Stuff
For developers and those interested in the screen saver code:

Additional code is provided in each file that will enable you to run the specific screen saver file by itself if you wish:

This is the Python code:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    screensaver()

With this, you can just run the file circular.py or just hexagonal.py, etc.
