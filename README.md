# PyScreenSaver
A simple screensaver program for Python built using Tkinter and Turtle. The following text is from the original documentation I made a long time ago. I found this project that I made a while ago and I decided to continue it.

By Urban Versis 32

This code is designed to run in Python 3. This is insured in the Screen Saver Dashboard with checking code.

NOTE: If you get a few unfriendly errors in the terminal (the black screen) when closing out of screensavers, that is not an issue.

Versions

v0.1.0 - The original project

Python Modules Used

turtle
tkinter
tkinter.ttk
random
time
sys

For developers and those interested in the screen saver code:

Additional code is provided in each file that will enable you to run the specific screen saver file by itself:

This is the Python code:

# Run and Developer Stuff
if __name__ == "__main__":
    screensaver()


With this, you can just run the file circular.py or just hexagonal.py, etc.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

This python application was programmed with Python 3.6.9, however most Python 3 versions should be compatiable

The Python 2 testing for the version checking code was version 2.7.17

Since January 1, 2020, Python 2 has had its official end-of-life.

The tkinter and tkinter.ttk modules may not by default be available; however, you can easily install it with help at https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html

If there is a folder in the main directory called "System Volume Information", please don't edit or delete it!
